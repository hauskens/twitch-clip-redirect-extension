# Twitch Clip Redirect Plugin

The intention of this Firefox extension is to automatically send you to `clips.twitch.tv` when using `twitch.tv` clip links.

This is because the clip player on `twitch.tv` is glitchy and has been so for several months.

Before using this plugin, do us all a favor by upvoting the issue:
